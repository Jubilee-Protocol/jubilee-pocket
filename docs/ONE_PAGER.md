## What is Jubilee Pocket?

Jubilee Pocket is a **self-repaying lending protocol** built exclusively for the **Solana Seeker**. It transforms your device into a revenue-generating asset by letting you borrow against your staked tokens while yield automatically pays down your debt.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  1. DEPOSIT     │ →→→ │  2. BORROW      │ →→→ │  3. EARN        │

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Deposit
Stake your SKR (Stakehouse Keeper Receipts) as collateral in the Guardian Vault.

### Step 2: Borrow
Instantly mint jUSDi stablecoins at up to 55% LTV. Swap to USDC via Jupiter if needed.

### Step 3: Earn
Your staking rewards automatically pay down your debt. Your loan shrinks while you hold.
